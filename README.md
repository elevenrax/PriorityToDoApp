# Priority To Do App

This application demonstrates creating an SQLite database with `SQLiteOpenHelper`. Defining the Database schema with `BaseColumns`. As well as using `ContentProvider` to provide `Uri` Access to CRUD operations on the database, both within the application and without. 

The app also implements an `ItemTouchHelper` to provide Swipe to delete behaviour.
